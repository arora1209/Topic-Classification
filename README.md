# Topic-Classification
Classify texts on the basis of keywords into 11 different categories.
I have taken a news data which have news of different genres like Politics, sports, entertainment etc. Data consist Genre , Headline , and short description.
Initially there were 41 categories , out of which I have taken only 11 categories by deleting and merging initial categories.
Then I have extracted keywords from the headline and description column and trained my Data-Set on Naibe-bayes and got 71% accuracy.
